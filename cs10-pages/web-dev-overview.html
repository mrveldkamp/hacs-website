<h3>What is a Web Page?</h3>
<p>A web page consists of a bunch of files that get displayed by a web browser.</p>
<p>A simple web page will usually include the following files:
</p>
<div class="combo-box">
  <div class="box1">
    <img src="images/webpage-files.PNG" width="300px">
  </div>
  <div class="box2">
    <h4>images folder...</h4>
    <p>...contains the image files to be used in the web page.</p>
    <h4>styles.css...</h4>
    <p>...contains the style rules that control things like color, fonts, layout, etc.</p>
    <h4>index.html...</h4>
    <p>...contains the content of a web page and is the document that the web browser will open. This document tells the browser
      how to put together the content, styles and images for the web page.</p>

<h3>Publishing a Web Page</h3>

  <p>Website files are hosted on web servers.  Upon request, the servers "serve" the files to individual computer users.  The Internet makes it all possible.</p>
  <p><img src="images/how-web-works.png" style="border: 1px solid grey; border-radius: 10px;"></p>

    <p>It is recommended to develop and test web pages on a local computer before uploading them to a public server. This local development
      will be the main focus of this course.</p>
